                "\nNote that the position of the ~, !, and 0 symbols is not related to the position of the digit it is based on (i.e., the ~ symbol does not necessarily mean the 5 is the number that is in the correct place). " +
                "\nThe secret code will consist of non-repeating numbers 1 through 9, or five case-insensitive letters that make up a real word. Have fun!" +
